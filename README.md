This is a simple convolutional neural network developed in C as part of my university exam. Unfortunately, one of the constraints for the exam was to use linked lists to implement the program, which is why the neural network's performance is somewhat slower.
Furthermore , i also added a pdf document containing the presentation describing the interface for this project.(in italian)
